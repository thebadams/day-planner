## Description
This is a daily event planner, meant to track daily tasks, meetings, events, etc. It shows the standard work hours (9AM - 5PM) in different cells.
## Instructions
The User may interact with the web application in the following ways:

1. When the user clicks on the content cell, a cursor will appear and the user will be able to edit the contents of that box.
1. When the user clicks on the save icon, the web application will save the contents of that box.
1. When the user refreshes the application, any items in storage will appear in the correct boxes until cleared.

## Expected Behavior
1. The current day is displayed in the header of the page.
1. The current day's time block is highlighted in red, and this changes throughout the day.
1. Time blocks indicating a past time in the day are grayed out.
